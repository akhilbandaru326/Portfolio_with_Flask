# Portfolio_with_Flask
The core web task is to build a personal portfolio site using Flask. The required tools for development include the Python Flask framework, HTML for structuring the page, and CSS for styling the presentation. The deliverables are the Flask project folder, which will result in a real-world mini web app. To complete this, the developer must first set up Flask routing (defining the URL paths), then create the index.html file to house the content, and finally, add a contact form for user interaction. Akhil possesses strong foundational web skills, including experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Node.js.
